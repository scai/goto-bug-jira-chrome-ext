Goto Bug (for Jira) Chrome Extension
========================

The "Goto Bug" extension helps you quickly open a Jira issue page by bug number. After installation, there will be a small icon inn your Chrome toobar. You can select a project short name and type in the bug number to open the issue page. It also shows 5 recent visited issue pages.

The extension tries to re-use your existing tabs. If a bug page is already open, it will activate that tab instead of creating a new one.

To configure the extension, you just need to provide a sample Jira URL and the extension will try to guess the link patterns for you.

The extension is available for install at: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ocjecccldncbghkfbplmopcgafnfffoc
